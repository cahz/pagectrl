                               --------

This package makes it simple to manage page requirements on your
document (minimums and maximums).  Install the package through the
usual means and issue

    \usepackage[range=15-20]{pagectrl}

for the most basic usage.  This will set up your document to issue a
warning if it is not at least 15 pages or over 20 pages long.

                               --------

If you would like to control how `pagectrl' reports a page length
issue, simply pass it in as another package option:

    \usepackage[range=15-20,report-as=error]{pagectrl}

Instead of a warning, `pagectrl' will issue an error to let you know
something is wrong.  `report-as=warning' is the default.

                               --------

The value of the `report-as' key maps cleanly onto the message classes
of `l3msg' within `expl3'.  It can be any of them:

- info     :: issue a statement in the log file
- warning  :: issue a statement in the log file and terminal output
- error    :: issue a normal error
- critical :: issue a critical error
- fatal    :: issue a fatal error

                               --------

Any and all bugs should be reported via the issue tracker on GitHub
(linked above).  If you do not have and do not wish to make a (free)
GitHub account, phrase the report in the form of a question and ask on

    http://tex.stackexchange.com

Someone will probably send it my way or be able to report it as a bug.
